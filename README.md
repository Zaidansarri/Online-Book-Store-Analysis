# **Online Book Store - SQL Project**

This project involves designing and executing SQL queries to analyze and manage data for an **Online Book Store**. The dataset includes information on books, customers, and orders, providing insights into sales, inventory, and customer behavior.

## Key Features
- **Retrieve Books by Genre**: Fetch books based on their genre (e.g., Fiction, Fantasy, etc.).
- **Identify Bestselling Books**: Determine the most frequently ordered books.
- **Analyze Customer Purchases**: List customers who placed multiple orders.
- **Calculate Revenue**: Compute total revenue generated from sales.
- **Stock Management**: Find books with the lowest stock and track remaining inventory.

- **SQL** (Structured Query Language)
- **MySQL / PostgreSQL** (or any relational database system)
- **Database Management & Query Optimization**
